Hello! I'm Jan Kowalski, the founder of The Happy Paws Hotel and a certified canine physiotherapist. My journey began over a decade ago with a simple mission: to create a safe, joyful, and restorative space for dogs. I believe that every dog deserves not just care, but true well-being. Here, I combine my passion for animal welfare with professional expertise to ensure every guest at Happy Paws feels like family.
